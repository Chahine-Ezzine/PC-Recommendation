1) I used VITE as a React build tool, so use if you want to run the code, write: npm start, than npm run dev

2) from the landing page, If you want to see the second page which is Search-PC, click on search button

3) from the second page "Search-PC" if you want to see the third page which is LaptopDetail, click on ant check it button

4) run npm install react-icons, because I used react icon library.
